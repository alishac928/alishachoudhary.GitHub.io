NASA's Socioeconomic Data & Applications Center (SEDAC) is a crossroads of the disciples of earth science and social sciences. It facilitates the development of applications to study anthropogenic effects via data from both fields. In this day & age, the effects of climate change are well felt & the implications are understood to be grave. Studying the intersection of these fields will be vital to prevent a worsening situation.
