# About Me

Hello! I'm Alisha Choudhary, a recent graduate with a Master's in Astronomy from San Diego State University and a Bachelor's in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from the University of California, Irvine. I have a strong background in data analysis and software development, with experience in Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, and Jupyter Notebooks. I have taught a physics circuit lab and am currently teaching an Astronomy 101 course. I enjoy participating in astronomy community outreach which has spanned me giving planetarium shows, operating multiple telescopes, helping with a proposal, and aiding Girl Scouts in completing badge requirements!

Throughout my academic journey, I have worked extensively with big data and data analytics, honing my skills as a creative problem solver and fast learner. I am passionate about leveraging my technical and quantitative skills to provide strategic input and innovative solutions. I'm excited to apply my transferable skills in new and challenging environments.

Check out my projects below to see some of the work I've done!

# Road Repair Investigators
In this project, I investigated the processing of road repair requests in San Diego County. By analyzing socioeconomic, topographical, application, and anecdotal data, I aimed to uncover potential biases in the prioritization of repair requests. Collaborating with two other graduate students, we developed web tools to host and distribute our findings, which are available at Road Repair Investigators.

# Exploring Metallicity Relations of Young Stellar Populations
In this project, I investigated metallicity gradients in young stellar populations of galaxies using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. Inspired by recent findings on the stellar fundamental metallicity relation (sFMR), I aimed to identify metallicity trends in stellar populations younger than 300 Myr. By filtering and analyzing data from the Pipe3D Value Added Catalogue, I created metallicity gradient maps and identified distinct patterns among different galaxy types, such as blobs, inkblots, holes, and cigars. This research contributes to our understanding of galaxy evolution by providing insights into the ongoing processes in young stellar populations.

# Measuring Exoplanet Radii: GJ-436b & WD 1856+534b
This project involved observing the transits of two exoplanets, GJ-436b and WD 1856+534b, using the 40-inch telescope at Mount Laguna Observatory. By capturing photometric data and modeling the transits' light curves using AstroImageJ (AIJ), I deduced the radii of these exoplanets. The radius of GJ-436b was determined to be 0.31419 ± 0.01803 RJ, and the radius of WD 1856+534b was found to be 0.92804 ± 0.03826 RJ. This project utilized advanced photometric techniques and data analysis tools to contribute to the understanding of exoplanetary characteristics.

# Publications
I am excited to share that I have been published on The Astronomer's Telegram [here](https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15779). I aided in obtaining photometry of the nova M31N 1984-07a.
