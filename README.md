Hello! I'm Alisha Choudhary, a recent graduate with a Master's in Astronomy from San Diego State University and a Bachelor's in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from the University of California, Irvine. I have a strong background in data analysis and software development, with experience in Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, and Jupyter Notebooks.

Throughout my academic journey, I have worked extensively with big data and data analytics, honing my skills as a creative problem solver and fast learner. I am passionate about leveraging my technical and quantitative skills to provide strategic input and innovative solutions. I'm excited to apply my transferable skills in new and challenging environments.

Check out my projects below to see some of the work I've done!

#Road Repair Investigators
In this project, I investigated the processing of road repair requests in San Diego County. By analyzing socioeconomic, topographical, application, and anecdotal data, I aimed to uncover potential biases in the prioritization of repair requests. Collaborating with two other graduate students, we developed web tools to host and distribute our findings, which are available at Road Repair Investigators.
